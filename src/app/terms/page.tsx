            <p>The content on this site is general information about what {SITE.name} builds. It is not a quote. Prices, timelines, and outcomes for your company are set in a written scope you sign before any work starts.</p>

          <div>
            <h2 className="h3 text-fg mb-3">Results pages</h2>
            <p>Where a results page is marked as a target outcome, the numbers describe what an engagement is designed to achieve, not a completed client deployment. Named case studies are published only with client approval.</p>

          <div>
            <h2 className="h3 text-fg mb-3">Client work</h2>
            <p>Every engagement is governed by its own written agreement, which covers scope, price, ownership, and support. That agreement takes precedence over anything on this site.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
