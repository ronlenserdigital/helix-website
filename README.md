# Helix Research Technologies website

helixresearchtech.com. Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind 4, TypeScript. Deployed on Vercel.

Full rebuild, 2026-09-29, from the competitor research and ADR-001 in Helix-Vault (`Business/`). Positioning: AI agents for lab, medical, and B2B supply companies. Hero is the lead form. Every lead lands in GoHighLevel.

## Run it

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill what you have, everything is optional for local dev
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
npm run build && npm start   # production check
npm run lint
```

Node 22 or newer.

## Push to a new repo

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/ronlenserdigital/helix-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

Then in Vercel: New Project, import the repo, framework Next.js, root `.`, no build overrides. Add the env vars below. Point `helixresearchtech.com` at the new project (Cloudflare DNS: CNAME to `cname.vercel-dns.com`). Vercel Hobby is non-commercial; use Pro.

## Env vars (Vercel > Settings > Environment Variables)

| Key | Needed for | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| `GHL_API_KEY` | Leads into GHL | Private integration token, contacts.write scope |
| `GHL_LOCATION_ID` | Leads into GHL | Sub-account location id |
| `GHL_FIELD_NEED_ID`, `GHL_FIELD_BUDGET_ID`, `GHL_FIELD_MESSAGE_ID` | Optional | Custom field ids; without them need/budget go in as tags and the message as a note |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GHL_CALENDAR_URL` | Calendar on /contact | Booking widget URL, white-label domain if you have one |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`, `LEAD_NOTIFY_EMAIL` | Optional email copy of each lead | Resend account, verified sending domain |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID` | Analytics | GTM container; GA4 tag inside it |

With no env vars set the site still builds and runs. The form returns ok, logs the lead to the server console, and redirects to /contact. Do not launch like that.

## Design system

Official and minimal, in the register of Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta: white page, one ink color pulled from the logo, one soft surface, hairlines, pill buttons, large type with a second gray tone for emphasis. No decoration that is not information.

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Page | `#ffffff`; soft sections `.section-soft` `#f5f5f4` |
| Ink | `#0e1c2d` (logo navy). Dark surfaces (footer, CTA band) use the same ink |
| Headings | Inter Tight 600, tight tracking. `<Em>` renders the second phrase in gray `#7b7f88`, never italic, never colored |
| Body | Inter, `#5c6069`. Labels (`.chapter`, `.fig`, `.num`) small Inter 500 gray |
| Accent | logo blue `#1566b9`, reserved for links inside content. Green `#2f9e6a` only for "yes" states |
| Buttons | `.btn-primary` ink pill, white on dark. `.btn-ghost` gray-100 pill |
| Cards | white with `#e7e8ea` hairline, 20px radius. `.card-soft` gray surface, no border. No shadows |

Blueprint-era classes (`.strand-*`, `.rungs*`, `.orbit`, `.crosshair`, `.dim`, `.card-marks`, `.watermark`) are kept as no-ops in `globals.css` so old markup renders clean. The hero flow (`src/components/helix-flow.tsx`) is three quiet cards: request, agent, quote.

Photos: real founder photos go in `public/founders/` as `ron.jpg`, `martin.jpg`, `constantine.jpg`, `thomas.jpg`; update `photo` paths in `src/data/founders.json`. Until then the cards show initials.

## Edit map (copy lives in data, not components)

| Change | File |
|--------|------|
| Phone, email, city, hours, socials, stats, guarantee, calendar note | `src/data/site.json` |
| Services (names, bullets, deliverables, timelines) | `src/data/services.json` |
| Industry pages (signals, use cases, FAQ) | `src/data/industries.json` |
| Results / case studies | `src/data/cases.json` |
| FAQ | `src/data/faq.json` |
| Pricing tiers, budget tiers, project shapes | `src/data/pricing.json` |
| Comparison tables and compare pages | `src/data/compare.json` |
| Founders (names, roles, credentials, LinkedIn, photos) | `src/data/founders.json` + `public/founders/` |
| Tool / partner badges in the marquee | `src/data/badges.json` |
| Hero headline and subhead | `src/components/hero.tsx` |
| Homepage section order | `src/app/page.tsx` |
| All reusable sections | `src/components/sections.tsx` |
| Design tokens, buttons, glass, animations | `src/app/globals.css` |
| Lead API (GHL, email, rate limit, honeypot) | `src/app/api/lead/route.ts` |
| JSON-LD | `src/components/json-ld.tsx` |
| OG image | `src/app/opengraph-image.tsx` |
| Sitemap, robots, llms.txt | `src/app/sitemap.ts`, `src/app/robots.ts`, `public/llms.txt` |

Any value containing `TODO` in the data files is hidden on the site automatically (`isTodo()` in `src/lib/data.ts`). Replace the value and it appears. Nothing with TODO ever renders.

## Before launch (the 10 fields)

1. `site.json`: `phone`, `phoneDisplay`, `socials.linkedin`, `calendarUrl` (or the env var), `guarantee` (set `enabled: true` once wording is agreed).
2. `founders.json`: credentials, roles, and LinkedIn for Martin, Constantine, and Thomas. Real photos in `public/founders/`, then update the `photo` paths.
3. `pricing.json`: audit `price` (currently `TODO`, renders as "Priced").
4. `cases.json`: replace the three placeholder entries with real ones and set `status` to `"published"`. Until then they render as target outcomes with a visible label.
5. Vercel env vars above.
6. Run `npm run build`, then `grep -r "TODO" src/data` should return only fields you intend to leave hidden.
